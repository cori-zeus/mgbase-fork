# MODERN WARFARE SWEPS
This is **NOT** the official git repository. This is an unofficial fork of the original addon.

# FEATURES
* Game-accurate laser attachments
* Viewmodel offset cvars
* ADS mouse sensitivity options
* Miscellaneous improvements

## WHERE ARE THE ASSETS?
I'm releasing the scripts, but releasing the assets would likely get me a cease and desist order.

## HOW TO USE
As a result of many files being excluded, anyone who wants to use the fork will need to install the [original Workshop addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2459720887) installed. After downloading the addon, clone the repository to `GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons`. The cloned files will override the originals.

## MULTIPLAYER
If you are the host and using modified files, then I think it will work mostly fine. If you are connecting to another host that doesn't use modified files, then you probably won't see any of my changes.
