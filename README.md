# MODERN WARFARE SWEPS
This is **NOT** the official git repository, do not misconstrue this as such. This is simply an unofficial "fork" of the original addon.

## WHERE ARE THE ASSETS?
While I have made the scripts available, I chose not to include assets as they (obviously) almost universally belong to Infinity Ward and Activision. If any assets ever need to be modified, the modified version will be available in the repository.

## HOW TO USE
As a result of many files being excluded, anyone who wishes to use the fork will have to also have the [original Workshop addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2459720887) installed. After having downloaded the addon, clone the repository to `GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons`. The cloned scripts will override the originals.

## MULTIPLAYER
If you are the host and using modified files, then I think it will work just fine. If you are connecting to another host that doesn't use modified files, then you probably will not see any of my changes. 

---

I hereby permit the developers of the original addon to use my code in their project as they see fit. I'd use the GPL v3 license, but that's not really my call.
